/**
 *  Doom Port to the nRF52840 by Nicola Wrachien (next-hack in the comments)
 *
 *  This port is based on the excellent doomhack's GBA Doom Port,
 *  with Kippykip additions.
 *  
 *  Several data structures and functions have been optimized 
 *  to fit in only 256kB RAM of nRF52840 (GBA has 384 kB RAM). 
 *  Z-Depth Light has been restored with almost no RAM consumption!
 *  Tons of speed optimizations have been done, and the game now
 *  runs extremely fast, despite the much higher 3D resolution with
 *  respect to GBA.
